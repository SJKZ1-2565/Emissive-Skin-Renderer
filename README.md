# Emissive Skin Renderer

This mod makes your own skin and player head glow! (same as Enderman eyes), Additionally causes colored horse armor to
glow.

Recommend using Complementary Shader with my mod, It makes your skin MOST beautiful!

How to use it?

Press E to open your inventory screen then press the button that has leather armor on it will open the Skin Editor
screen, Press Create Skin Button to create your glowing skin!

Hope you guys enjoy it, Thank you!

Special If u paid for this mod I'll do special things for you(Early Access, Discord Role)
